# PythonDigitRecognitionNN
a program that can guess hand written digits using a neural network

How to use program:

step 1 run code using a python IDE (I used pycharm to make this program).

step 2 construct network using the "Construct Neural Network..." button.

step 3 in the pop up window a specify traning files by either entering path in text field or using windows explorer (Open...).
      note: training files are provided with the repoistory. named "tr_X.txt" and "tr_y.txt".
      
step 4 specify number of hidden neurons (recomended: 128).
      note: the higher the number of neurons is the more prossessing power the program needs. if the number is to high the program might crash or freeze.

once training is complete:
  now you can let the program guess the digits you write as shown in the demo video in this repo
  
  to put the pen down for drawing press the space bar to start drawing once done press space bar again to lift the pen.
  
once done drawing: 
  press predict digit button and listen for it.
